Kai System ‚Äì Offline AI Orchestrator with Autonomous Squads, Model Fusion, and Workflow Automation Kai is a fully offline, sovereign AI system built to operate with complete autonomy, high modularity, and maximum real-world utility. It coordinates multiple local LLMs through a central decision core and distributes work via squads, all communicating over an internal EventBus. Everything is designed to function without cloud reliance, respecting both data integrity and GDPR compliance.

üîß Core System Components Kai Orchestrator: Final authority for output. Filters, verifies, and fuses model responses, ensuring no raw hallucinations or rogue actions reach the user.

EventBus: Central nervous system. All model outputs, commands, tasks, memory updates, and tool signals flow through this unified communication layer.

Fusion Engine: Handles fallback logic, multi-model voting, and team stacking (e.g., Mistral + LLaMA3 combos). Prioritizes accuracy through scoring and consensus.

Supervisor: Oversees real-time execution, logs failures, enforces task priority, and quarantines faulty outputs or failing modules.

Junior (Self-Healing Agent): Autonomous system engineer. Handles backup integrity, quarantine scans, environment syncs, and automated CLI repairs.

üß† Squad System Each squad operates like a task-specific microservice ‚Äî equipped with its own tools, hooks, and memory logs.

Squads currently include: engineering, accounting, trading, survey, research, and document_processing.

Future squads can be added by dropping them into the squads/ folder and registering them in the tool manager.

üì¶ Tool Manager and Environment Libraries Each squad links to a curated Environment Library, managed by the Tool Manager:

Engineering: LibreCAD, CSV-to-ASB, 3CAT, QGIS, elevation processors, PDF survey extractors. Trading: Arbitrage engines, strategy testers, real-time API hooks (future), logging dashboards. Accounting: KMyMoney, invoice generators, timesheet trackers, ledger tools. Survey: Leica integration tools, topographical renderers, volume calculators. R&D: Reinforcement learning kits, AutoML platforms (e.g. AutoGluon, Stable Baselines3, H2O.ai). Docs: LibreOffice, OCR, PDF-to-text, form processors. üåê GUI + Automation Ubuntu-native Dashboard GUI: Operates like a browser ‚Äî each squad gets its own window/tab for live updates, task entry, and monitoring.

n8n Integration: Fully wired for event-driven automation:

Inputs: Email, Telegram, WhatsApp, file uploads. Outputs: Auto-responses, email reports, dashboard logs, task completion triggers. Middleware: Can connect actions like ‚Äúsurvey file ‚Üí parse ‚Üí ASB sheet ‚Üí send email.‚Äù üîí Key Design Principles 100% offline-capable, all models local. Extensible: Just add new .py modules or squad/ folders ‚Äî no cloud APIs required. Memory-driven: State awareness is preserved via persistent logs. Autonomy: System can run daily tasks, self-repair, and enforce logic flow without human input. GitHub-Ready: Structured for static code review, logic tracing, and collaborative debugging. Note: Model binaries are excluded from repo ‚Äî expected paths are defined in the brain registry. All logic assumes local deployment, but can be scaled to private cloud if needed.
